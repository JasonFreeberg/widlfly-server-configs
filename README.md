# Widlfly Server Configuration Files

This repository is a reference for developers using the managed Wildfly service on Azure App Service for Linux. The `appconfig/` directory contains the modules, module dependencies, jar files, and shell scripts necessary to configure the Wildfly application server to use Service Bus for JMS. If you are using this as a reference for development, please note that the jar files may be outdated at the time of reading, and you should check the [download site](https://qpid.apache.org/download.html) for the newest versions.

Please see the [Quickstart for Wildfly]() as it follows the same configuration pattern. The tutorial uses different modules and dependencies, but the process is the same.

Happy hacking!
