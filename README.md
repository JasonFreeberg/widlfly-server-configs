# Widlfly Server Configuration Files

This repository is a reference for developers using the managed Wildfly service on Azure App Service for Linux. The `appconfig/` directory contains the modules, module dependencies, jar files, and shell scripts necessary to configure the Wildfly application server to use Service Bus for JMS.

Please see the [Quickstart for Wildfly]() as it follows the same configuration pattern. The tutorial uses different modules and dependencies, but the process is the same.
